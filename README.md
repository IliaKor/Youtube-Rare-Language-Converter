# Youtube-Rare-Language-Converter
In the quest to learn Albanian, I noticed a shortage of comprehensible input by means of compelling media at my level. This script allows one to translate the transcript (assuming one exists) of any English language Youtube video in order to study later and listen back to the audio. Plans to expand into a more fully orbed app.
